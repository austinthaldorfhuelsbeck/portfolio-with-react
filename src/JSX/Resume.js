          <strong>CSS</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also learning to program in <strong>JavaScript</strong> with
          <strong>Node.js</strong> &amp; <strong>React</strong>. These
          technologies form the base of my daily approach to development.
        </p>
        <p>
          For server-side development, I am learning the{" "}
          <strong>Express</strong> framework. I am passionate about both
          client-side and server-side development, and it is important to me to
          be well-versed in both.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use <strong>Git</strong> &amp; <strong>GitHub</strong> to manage
          revisions for all of my projects. Check out my{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          My preferred code editor is <strong>VSCode</strong>. I am quite
          comfortable working in both <strong>Windows</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>OS X</strong>, with basic knowledge of

        <h2>Video &amp; Design</h2>
        <p>
          I have been shooting and editing video professionally for over six
          years. From freelance, to startups, to an established institution, I
          have been able to work with a wide variety of clients and deliver
          results on-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond communication and professionalism, this experience has also
          allowed me to develop strong skills with{" "}
          <strong>Adobe Creative Cloud</strong>, including Photoshop, Premiere
          Pro, Illustrator, Lightroom, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also gained real-world experience designing graphics and video
          for the web, managing content using tools like <strong>Libsyn</strong>{" "}
          &amp; <strong>Wordpress</strong>. I have been able to lead and
          contribute to digital marketing campaigns, drawing data-driven
          conclusions alongside a Marketing team.
